# Simple-Customisable-MCOM-Example
This is the code for the Introduction to MCOMs video demonstrating how to use MCOMs in modes. 
The video runs through the basic use of all of the blocks available for MCOMs. 
The game mode itself is a simple extension to the rush game mode with each side having their own MCOMs and each side attempting to destroy the other sides MCOMs in sequence. 
This version of the mode is an extension to the final one in the video which will allow you to add more maps to the game
and customise the positioning of the MCOMs.
Just extend the subroutine 'initialiseMCOMs'. The orbital MCOMs are provided as an example which you can change.
To extend just add an else if add add the condition for the map you want to add, then copy over the code for the position and fuse times and alter accordingly.
